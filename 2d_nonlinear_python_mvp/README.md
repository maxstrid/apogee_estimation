# 2D Nonlinear Python MVP

This section solves a full nonlinear MPC problem once and applies that over a simulated trajectory.

This gives us a working controller within ~150 iterations.

The next steps are proper simulation with added noise and external force and using an online iLQR around an offline MPC guess.
